# Hogwarts Alumni ⚡️

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web application for Harry Potter fans who want to search for a
character, view information about a character, "favorite" a character & view a list of their favorite characters.

## Why I Built This

As a Harry Potter fan, I've always loved learning fun facts about Harry Potter characters. I built Hogwarts Alumni so that Harry Potter fans could easily find information about a particular Harry Potter character. Fun facts such as a character's birthday, which house they belong in or if they're pure-blood, half-blood or muggleborn wizards.
